## Replication Code and Analysis
All coding scripts needed for replication and analysis are located in the /docs folder and are described below. Code used to produce all tables, figures, and numbers in the final manuscript are inline in the /paper folder

[01 DV](https://github.com/jandresgannon/AlliesArmaments/blob/main/docs/01_dv-specialization.qmd) - creates the specialization index used for the dependent variable from the rDMC dataset

[02 EV](https://github.com/jandresgannon/AlliesArmaments/blob/main/docs/02_ev-countryyear.qmd) - creates a dataframe of the explanatory variables and controls

[03 Full dataframe](https://github.com/jandresgannon/AlliesArmaments/blob/main/docs/03_full-df.qmd) - merges the two dataframes together
